# Dynamic Network Visualisation (DNV)
Description:
- What does the app do? Optimises the process for choosing similarity measures for drug profiling data. What is novel?

## Purpose/Significance/History
Aligned with an intelligence-led approach, knowledge gained from strategic, operational or tactical level analyses needs to be disseminated to relevant decision-makers in a timely manner [18]. Furthermore, presenting information in the form of visualisations can provide vital support in the decision making process [102]. Currently, the types of visualisations created to support intelligence-led policing are static in nature [39, 102]; limiting the potential of the supplied information. To create actionable intelligence, it is important that drug markets and their features can be viewed in an interactive and dynamic way.

Objectives: 
- Objective 1 
- Objective 2


This project is part of a Austraian Research Council grant (number.)


- This README will take you through (contents page)

## Install 
access to shinyapps.io 

## Usage
- Currently this is the state of the app. This is the way it works.
- It has three main tabs (DATA, NETWORK and ANALYSIS)

### DATA TAB
#### Example Data

#### Optimisation of data for network plotting 

### NETWORK TAB
#### Network plot

#### Summary
Will have data from your lookup

### ANALYSIS TAB
#### Spatial - Strategic level

#### Temporal - Strategic level 

## Future direction
Still not finished :O
